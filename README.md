This is a test blog application built in Ruby on Rails. It follows the Getting Started with Rails tutorial found at: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.1/getting_started.html

The deployed application may be seen at: https://floating-fjord-29956.herokuapp.com/

Currently the delete function is not working (though it was on an earlier commit). This is a result of missing JQuery dependency which does not work on recent versions of Ruby. Functionality may be restored at a later point and this may be irrelevant.
